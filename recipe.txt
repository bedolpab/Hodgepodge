                       HDOGEPODGE
                JUST PREPARING FOR A ROLE !
===========================================================

What is this? Well, this is my interview prep material. Why
am I calling it Hodgepodge? Well, that's why, because I 
honestly do not know what will end up here. However, let's 
hope it plays into the next interview I take. It's all
related somehow though, i think (just trust me).

Oh, and I'll be writing them in Python, C, and Rust (trying).
That's gonna be fun.


>> LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS <<

While preparing to apply for AI-roles, many, in my experience,
are understanding how to use LLM-API wrappers to integrate
into existing software—it is highly uncommon you'll be training
foundational models. That being said, you'll be interacting
with LLMs extensively, more if you're actually using any
fine-tuning tools, RAG, or any relevant techniques of sorts.

[Q-1]: What is tokenization? 

[A-1]: Tokenization, or tokenizing, is a process that occurs
       after prompting a model and before embeddings are
       created, which are the inputs to the model.

        PROMPT -> TOKENIZE(PROMPT) -> EMBBED(TOKENS)
